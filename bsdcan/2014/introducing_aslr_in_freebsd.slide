* Agenda
- Definitions
- History of ASLR (according thusly to ye olde Wikipedia)
- FreeBSD's security strengths
- FreeBSD's security weaknesses
- Learning from others
- How ASLR is implemented
- Future research/work
- Live demo

* Definitions
- Security: What Sony's not good at. Ever-increasing layers of an onion that make everyone tear up.
- Exploit mitigation: a way to prevent the exploitation of security vulnerabilities.
- ASLR - Address Space Layout Randomization: An exploit mitigation technique by which the memory mappings of a given process are placed in random locations.

* History of ASLR
- October 2002: One or more talented persons, known as the PaX team, created a patch to the Linux kernel implementing ASLR.
- 2004: OpenBSD starts work on implementing ASLR. Gets everything except for execbase randomization (Position Independent Executables).
- June 2005: Linux rips PaX's ASLR, dumbing it down and calling it secure.
- 2007: Windows Vista introduces ASLR. Major problems with their implementation, even today.
- 2008: OpenBSD completes ASLR implementation with PIE support.
- 2011: ASLR introduced in Solaris 11

Thank you Wikipedia University!

* FreeBSD's Security Strengths

Mostly based on policies:

- MAC framework
- NFSv4 and Posix ACLs
- Securelevel
- auditdistd
- Jails (and soon/now: bhyve)

Non-policy technologies:

- Non-exec stack
- ptrace restriction

* FreeBSD's Security Weaknesses

- Only one exploit mitigation technology: non-exec stack
- No PIE support in base
- No ASLR
- The many features of grsec

* Learning From Others - Linux
- Hooray politics!
- Only one knob: turn ASLR on and off
